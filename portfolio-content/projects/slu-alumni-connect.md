# SLU Alumni Connect — Graduate Frontend Project

## Overview

SLU Alumni Connect is a web-based alumni engagement platform built during graduate coursework to centralize alumni, student, and administrative workflows into a role-based system with dashboards and data-driven views.

While academic in origin, the frontend was approached with production-grade discipline.

## Timeline and Context

- **Period:** August 2025 – December 2025
- **Location:** United States
- **Context:** Master’s in Information Systems
- **Status:** Completed as part of graduate coursework

## Problem Statement

Alumni information and engagement workflows were fragmented across spreadsheets, emails, and disconnected tools. This made it difficult to:

- track participation and engagement
- manage events and mentorship flows
- gain visibility into trends

The goal was to unify these workflows into a structured, usable system.

---

## My Role (Frontend Lead)

I led frontend development and translated requirements into usable interfaces:

- designed the frontend layout and structure
- built role-based dashboards
- implemented data-driven UI components
- integrated frontend views with backend APIs
- prioritized workflow clarity and usability by user type

---

## Frontend Architecture

- React + Next.js (App Router)
- component-driven dashboard layout
- reusable UI patterns for tables, metrics, and trend indicators
- role-based separation to avoid UI confusion across personas

---

## Dashboard and Data Presentation

Dashboards were designed to be decision-friendly:

- KPI-style cards for summary
- tables for detailed inspection
- visual cues for engagement patterns and trends

My earlier analytics exposure influenced how information was structured on the UI, with emphasis on readability and correct interpretation.

---

## Backend Integration (Context)

Backend services supported the frontend by providing structured data and enabling interactions (events, RSVPs, mentorship workflows). My focus remained on ensuring frontend components accurately reflected backend state.

---

## Deployment and Workflow

- deployed via Vercel
- version control via GitHub
- iterative refinement based on feedback and testing

---

## Scope Clarification

This project represents applied frontend architecture and data-driven UI design within an academic setting. It is not positioned as a large-scale production platform.
