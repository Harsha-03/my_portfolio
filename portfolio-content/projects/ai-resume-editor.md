# AI Resume Editor — Applied AI Productivity Tool

## Overview

The AI Resume Editor is a productivity-focused application designed to help users tailor resumes to specific job descriptions. The system identifies alignment gaps and supports iterative improvement through structured suggestions, rather than generic resume advice.

## Problem Statement

Most resume tools provide broad suggestions without considering the job description. That results in resumes that are polished but not role-aligned. The goal was to reduce this mismatch through structured analysis and AI-assisted rewriting.

---

## What It Does

- parses resumes (PDF / DOCX / TXT)
- accepts a job description
- identifies keyword and skill gaps
- suggests rewritten bullet points and summaries
- exports a tailored resume version

The workflow is intentionally iterative so users can refine content instead of accepting one-off output.
