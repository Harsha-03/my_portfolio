# Data & Analytics — Foundational Exposure

## Context

My exposure to data and analytics developed during my Master’s in Information Systems and supports how I design
interfaces and dashboards rather than representing a separate analytics specialization.

This knowledge influences how I structure frontend components that present and interact with data.

## Timeline

- **Period:** February 2025
- **Location:** United States
- **Academic context:** Master’s in Information Systems

## SPSS (Initial Exposure)

I first worked with **SPSS** as part of coursework focused on statistical analysis and data interpretation.

Through this work, I learned:

- How datasets are structured and cleaned
- How statistical outputs are generated
- How insights are derived from structured data rather than assumptions

The value of this experience was not the tool itself, but learning to reason about data systematically.

## Transition to Power BI

Working with SPSS highlighted a gap between analysis and communication.

To bridge this gap, I explored **Power BI**, focusing on:

- Building interactive dashboards
- Visualizing trends and comparisons
- Structuring data to support decision-making

Power BI aligned more closely with my frontend interests by treating visualization as a user-facing layer.

## How This Informs My Frontend Work

This analytics exposure directly affects how I build frontend systems:

- I design dashboards with awareness of what the data represents
- I prioritize clarity, hierarchy, and readability
- I treat UI as a communication layer between data and users

Rather than positioning analytics as a primary role, I use this knowledge to build **data-aware user interfaces**
that support real workflows.

## Scope Clarification

This experience does not represent advanced statistical modeling or data science work.

It represents:

- Foundational analytics exposure
- Tool familiarity
- Better-informed frontend and dashboard design
