## Founding and Collaboration

## Client Acquisition and Deal Closure

I led client acquisition directly:

## Project Scope and Delivery

BuiltinTech delivered **10+ paid client projects**, including:

Each engagement required clear scoping, functional delivery, and accountability for outcomes.

## End-to-End Ownership

Projects covered the full lifecycle:

## Technical Contribution

My technical contribution focused on frontend execution:

## Organizational Pause
