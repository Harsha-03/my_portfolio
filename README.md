# 🌌 My Portfolio

A **production-deployed personal portfolio** built with **Next.js (App Router)**, **React**, and **Tailwind CSS**, designed to be **stable, minimal, and recruiter-focused**.

This is not a demo or playground.  
It’s a real system that prioritizes **clarity, correctness, and long-term maintainability**.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

This portfolio exists to:

- Clearly communicate my experience and projects
- Avoid exaggeration or buzzwords
- Remain stable under real traffic
- Reflect how I approach production frontend systems

The UI and architecture were **intentionally refined**, not over-designed.
